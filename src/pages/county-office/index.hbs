          Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) are direct payments made in lieu of a marketing assistance loan when the CCC determined value, which is based on the current local price in a country, is below the applicable county loan rate. The payment is the difference between the two rates times the eligible quantity. For a commodity to be eligible for an LDP, the producers must have a beneficial interest in the commodity, in addition to other eligibility requirements.
